## DeviceFeature and Device Drivers - Appendix B: Device Registers and Parameter Block Layout

The document device-driver.md describes the overall device feature proposal and most parts of the detailed design.  Appendix A lists the standard virtual registers that all devices can implement.

This Appendix B defines the registers that are actually implemented by several known device drivers and the detailed format of the parameter block bodies they expect.

##Common Device Registers (CDR_)

###`CDR_DriverVersion`
###`CDR_LibraryVersion`

####Get version number and name of the DeviceDriver or supporting library.

Version numbers are in the Semantic Versioning format x.y.z-a.b.c  See [semver.org](http://semver.org) for more info.  

The first byte of the return data buffer is the size in bytes of the version identifier packet that follows.  Name strings use UTF-8 encoding and are null-terminated.

In the initial implementation, the size of the version identifier packet is 6 bytes.  The name string immediately follows the version identifier packet and is limited to 128 bytes maximum, including the null terminator.

The size of the receiving buffer should be large enough to hold the 1-byte packet size, a version identifier packet, and a name string (including the null terminator). If the buffer size is not large enough, an error will be returned (`EMSGSIZE`).

*Method signature*

`int status(int handle, CDR_DriverVersion, int bufSize, byte *buf)`
`int status(int handle, CDR_LibraryVersion, int bufSize, byte *buf)`

*Return data buffer*

     0  version descriptor packet size (6, in this example)
     1  major version (x)
     2  minor version (y)
     3  patch version (z)
     4  pre-release (a)
     5  pre-release (b)
     6  pre-release (c)
     7..n  name string (UTF-8, null terminated)



     0  version descriptor packet size (3, in this example)
     1  major version (x)
     2  minor version (y)
     3  patch version (z)
     4..n  name string (UTF-8, null terminated)

##MCP9808 Temperature Sensor

Note that most of the registers on this device are 16-bit (2-byte) and the device expects them to be written in Big Endian order and provides them to a reader in Big Endian order.  So, for reasons of consistency with the Microchip Technology datasheet for the device, the values in the parameter blocks for this device are arranged as Big Endian sequences.

The bytes can be easily put into whichever order is needed by the host using the macros and methods of the ByteOrder class.

###`CDR_Configure`

Get/set the configuration of the temperature sensor attached to the given handle and its associated software object.
